# R-ACT-R
Updated repository of the R-ACT-R model

This repository is supposed to contains the lattest version of the R-ACT-R system


# 01.11.2021:

. some changes were made to the 'functions.R' file, mainly about printing the output in sensible ways

. no "functional" changes though which means all earlier models should generate the same predictions
